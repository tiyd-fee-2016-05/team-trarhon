### It's about 9:20pm and so far I've corrected the alignment issues as well as organizing the <ul> for the repo list.
### Rhonda is in charge of the tab bar above the repo list.  
### Currently trying to get sizing of the text as well as the list items styled correctly.  
### 10:40: Finally able to align things properly...mostly...mostly.

### Rhonda 6-07 and 6-08

* I added added styling to the navbar and left side of the github page.
